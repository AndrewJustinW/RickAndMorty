        <div class=RMsummary>

            <p>After having been missing for nearly 20 years, Rick Sanchez suddenly arrives at daughter Beth's
                doorstep
                to move in with her and her family. Although Beth welcomes Rick into her home, her husband, Jerry,
                isn't as happy about the family reunion. Jerry is concerned about Rick, a sociopathic scientist,
                using
                the garage as his personal laboratory. In the lab, Rick works on a number of sci-fi gadgets, some
                of
                which could be considered dangerous. But that's not all Rick does that concerns Jerry. He also goes
                on
                adventures across the universe that often involve his grandchildren, Morty and Summer. </p>
